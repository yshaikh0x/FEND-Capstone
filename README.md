## Description
This is a Travel App project built as the final capstone for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree. It features a Weather Prediction Weatherbit API that is used to check the forecast of the city that will be travelled to, an image display of the location using Pixabay API and a Countdown Timer. An extra feature was added that displays the length of the trip.
